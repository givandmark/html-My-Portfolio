<h1>The Best Movies According to Mark!!</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies lately.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Warriors of Future</h3>
<p>This is a Si-Fi movie. It is action packed<br/>
with loads of realistic special affects.</p>
<h3>Stone</h3>
<p>This is a Thriller that will keep you on the<br>
edge of your seat, even though you know how it is going<br>
to end.</p>
<h3>Dune</h3>
<p>This is a Si-Fi moive. I didn't think it would be as<br>
good as the original movie and it is not but they did<br> 
a pretty good job on it.</p>
